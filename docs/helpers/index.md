ngtx contains a set of small helper functions enabling you to write your tests with ease while becoming precise and readable throughout your test-cases. This documentation iterates through all helpers currently available in ngtx and explains when and how to use them.

- [get][get]
- [getAll][getall]

\* **deprecated**. The helpers marked with a star (\*) are deprecated since they do not work with [ngtx' declarative testing api][declarative] which is the go-to way of doing things by this time. For each deprecated helper, there is a declarative counter-part provided by ngtx.
