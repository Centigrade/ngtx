ngtx stands for "A**ng**ular **T**esting E**x**tensions" and is a small set of functions aiming to make your life easier when testing Angular components. It's supposed to make your tests lean while increasing the readability by boosting the semantics of each test case.

## Why?

All common things we do in Angular tests are quite verbose. We often find ourselves writing stuff that does not express our intensions, but really just are steps on our way to our test-goal. Furthermore, while we care about production code to be clean and easy to understand, our testing code is left WET instead of DRY and hard to understand on the first glance.

We can do better and we think we should. ngtx is meant to help you with that by "injecting" small "helpers" into your tests improving both, productivity and readability.
