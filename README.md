| üöß Ngtx Version 1 vs. Version 2 |
| ------------------------------- |
| We're currently redesigning the API of ngtx to improve it for more complex test szenarios. This api is experimental and not considered stable yet. When installing ngtx, **please make sure you're installing version 1** (`npm install -D @centigrade/ngtx@1`).

| -------------- |
| If you like to use ngtx version 2 today, you can refer to this [documentation][docs2] and install ngtx in version 2 (`npm install -D @centigrade/ngtx@2`).

# @Centigrade/ngtx

![](https://github.com/Centigrade/ngtx/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

ngtx stands for "A**ng**ular **T**esting E**x**tensions" and is a small set of functions aiming to make your life easier when testing Angular components. It's supposed to make your tests lean while increasing the readability by boosting the semantics of each test case.

# Why?

All common things we do in Angular tests are quite verbose. We often find ourselves writing stuff that does not express our intensions, but really just are steps on our way to our test-goal. We think the Angular testing world should be a bit different.
